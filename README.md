# Introduction-to-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-C
## Introduction 
This is my personal selection of notes and exercises intended to constitute an introductory course on Data Structures and Algorithms. 

## Prerequisites 
This material could be used by a novel programmer with no prior knowledge on the subject. A typical introductory course on programming should be enough to access this material without problems. The selected programming language is C, so a basic understanding of this language is advised. If you come frome another language consider getting a copy of the K&R book or some other equivalent resource before you move on.
