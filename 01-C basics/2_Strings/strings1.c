/*
 * Shows how to handle strings in C.
 *
 * C programming language does not include a string data type.
 * Strings in C are implemented as single dimension arrays of characters (vectors) terminated by the null character '\0'.
 *
 * The null character is used as a sentinel value to indicate where the string ends within the array.
 * Indeed this character is typically used by standard library functions for this purpose.
 *
 * Three important functions of the standard input/output library (stdio.h) that use this property and may be presented as example:
 *      1. printf("...%s...", array)
 *
 *          The %s format specifier inside the format string instructs printf to interpret the argument "array" as a string.
 *          I.e., printf is expecting to receive an array of char ended with '\0'.
 *          Then, printf will print each character of the array until it finds the null character '\0' (which will not be printed).
 *
 *          If the array passed is not a string, i.e. it does not have a null character in it, printf will keep printing values beyond the limits of the array until it finds a null.
 *
 *      2. scanf("...%s...", array)
 *
 *          The %s format specifier instructs scanf to interpret the characters received in the standard input as a string and to save them in the argument "array".
 *          Scanf will read each character of the input until it finds the first white space (space, new line, tab).
 *          Scanf will populate the "array" sequentially with those characters and will place a null character '\0' at the end.
 *
 *          Of course, is important to pass to scanf an array with sufficient capacity (dimension) to receive every character present at the input plus the null character.
 *          If this is not the case, no checking will be performed for us and scanf may overwrite anything located beyond the limits of the array in memory.
 *
 *      3. strlen(array)
 *          Counts how many characters are in the array until it reaches the null character '\0' (not included). Then returns that count.
